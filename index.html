            <p>
                I am mixed race hawaiian born and raised in the Rogue Valley of Southern Oregon and have been slowly making my way North to where I find myself now, Portland, OR.

            <p>
                Since childhood I have always occupied myself in creative endeavors. Some of my fondest memories revolve around copying the art in Nintendo Power magazine. As I grew older that love of illustration evolved into graffiti, and then tattooing.

            <p>
                For the past 8 years i have worked many in many different fields to support my lifestyle as a single father to one rad daughter, but am constantly searching for a career that can fulfill my creative passions.

                It is only natural that I find myself now in the world of UX design, where I can leave my fingerprints on the world in the form of clean, simple, research driven design.
